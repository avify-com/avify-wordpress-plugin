Connect your WooCommerce account to Avify and send all your orders to one centralized inventory.

== Description ==

[Avify is a platform that gives you a WhatsApp CRM](https://avify.com/?utm_source=WP.PLUGIN.PAGE&utm_medium=LINK.WEB), an online store (or connection to an existing one), and a point of sale system for physical stores, all in one place. 

By using [Avify](https://avify.com/?utm_source=WP.PLUGIN.PAGE&utm_medium=LINK.WEB), SMBs do not have to worry about maintaining inventory control manually since all sales channels affect a single centralized inventory. 

With our technology you can receive orders and payments coming from WordPress and merge them with any other one coming from social media interaction like Instagram, Facebook or WhatsApp. You can connect your logistics, payment and billing services so that any order that enters the business can process shipping price calculations, payment or transfer receipts, and receipts or invoices automatically.

With our plugin you will be able to sync orders and online payments in WooCommerce via Avify Integration. Also, you can connect multiple card payment systems and [Avify](https://avify.com/?utm_source=WP.PLUGIN.PAGE&utm_medium=LINK.WEB) displays them at your checkout.

Contact your dedicated support channel to get your API Key and the ID of your store.
